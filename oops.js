	Terminology
	Namespace
	A container which lets developers bundle all functionality under a unique, application-specific name.
	Class
	  Defines the object's characteristics. A class is a template definition of an object's properties and methods.
	Object
	  An instance of a class.
	Property
	  An object characteristic, such as color.
	Method
	  An object capability, such as walk. It is a subroutine or function associated with a class.
	Constructor
	  A method called at the moment an object is instantiated. It usually has the same name as the class containing it.
	Inheritance
	  A class can inherit characteristics from another class.
	Encapsulation
	  A method of bundling the data and methods that use the data.
	Abstraction
	  The conjunction of an object's complex inheritance, methods, and properties must adequately reflect a reality model.
	Polymorphism
	  Poly means "many" and morphism means "forms". Different classes might define the same method or property.

 /* Object:Expect Primitive types(string,boolean,number,null,undefined,symbol), All are objects in Javascript. 
    Javascript Can have properties And methods.
  Defination:
  Object is a non-primitive data type in JavaScript. It is like any other variable, 
  the only difference is that an object holds multiple values in terms of properties and methods. 
  Properties can hold values of primitive data types and methods are functions. */


 //creating emptyobject:   var car={};
 
// creating object: 
 // We can Create an object in number of ways

  // 1. using object literal notation 2. using Constructor 3. using object.create();
1.
 var Car={
	     name:'BMW',
         year:'2018',
		details:function(){
			console.log(this.name +  ' - ' +this.year +  ' - ' + this.owner);     // LITERAL NOTATION
			  }							   
		 };

		 Car.name | Car['name']    // Two ways of Accessing object property 
		 Car.owner="suresh";      // Add property to 'Cars' object
		 delete Car.year;         // Delete Propery From Object
	     Car.details();
	 
// Output:   BMW - 2018
// in above 'name','year' are properties And 'details' is a methods. And 'Car' is an object.

//2. using Constructor
//Constructor is a function that creates and initializes the newly created object.
var person=new Object();   // Object Creation using Constructor Function

 // Attach properties and methods to person object

   }
   person.getDetails(); // Accessing method 

//Accessing proprties And Methods
person.age; // 20
person.name; // rajesh
person.getDetails(); // rajesh - hyderabad

//hasOwnProperty(): 
//if we are trying to access properety does not exist in the object it returns "undefined".
// then we can use "hasOwnProperty()" method

console.log(person.salary);   // output: undefined
console.log(person['age']);   // Another way of Accessing property of object

if(person.hasOwnProperty('salary')){
	console.log(person.salary); 
}
else{
	console.log('no salary property');
}

//Access Object keys
for(var key in person){        // key or i
	console.log(key); // output: age name address getDetails
	console.log(person[key])  // output 20 rajesh hyderabad [Function] 	      
}

// Creating Costructor function
var Hotelinfo=function(name,address,price){

Q) WHAT IS "this" keyword 
   A)  1.this is a keyword in JavaScript. When it is used in a constructor, it refers to the instance that is created with the constructor.

          2.If you tried to console.log(this) in a constructor, you'd notice its the same as logging the instance itself.
		
          3. this in a constructor points to the instance

// ENCAPSULATION And ABSTRACTION

//"Encapsulation" is a concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.
//Abstraction : Through the process of "abstraction", a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency

 /* 
    We create objects with methods, properties, and attributes.
	When we make them bundled inside an object itâ€™s known as Encapsulation. 
	Encapsulation is the actual act of hiding the irrelevant details.
	
    Abstraction means- hiding implementation using abstract class and interfaces etc.
	When these methods and attributes are abstracted from other objects, this is known as abstraction.
	Abstraction is hiding the information or providing only necessary details to the client.


Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions operating on that data into a single component and restricting the access to some of the object's components.
Encapsulation means that the internal representation of an object is generally hidden from view outside of the object's definition.

Abstraction is a mechanism which represent the essential features without including implementation details.

Encapsulation:-- Information hiding.
Abstraction:-- Implementation hiding.
*/

// Here's an example of encapsulation:
1.
var prop1 = "one";  //private
this.prop2= "two"     //public
var tc = new test();
var tp1 =tc.prop1; //undefined: because prop1 is private;

// without using this keyword function and variables are private.

2.
var flights=function(){
var arrival="inda";
this.destination="London";
}

var airpott=new flights(); 
console.log(airpott.arrival);  //undefined  (can't Access private variable defined in funtion ->var)
console.log(airpott.destination); //London ( Access public variable defined in funtion  -> this )

var abc="sdsds";
function funsss(){
	var abc1="sada";
}
//funsss();
console.log(abc);

//Example for Encapsulation

const Dog = (name, breed, sound) => {
	const bark = () => console.log(sound);
	return {
	  name, breed, sound
	};
  }
  
  const dog = Dog('Fido', 'Collie', 'Grrrr');

 One way is as shown below. This works but the problem with this approach is that,

/* Using the prototype object to add functions : The following are the advantages of using the prototype object to add functions.
1. No matter how many objects you create, functions are loaded only once into memory
2. Allows you to override functions if required. */

/* In this video we will discuss Inheritance in JavaScript with an example.

Object oriented programming languages support inheritance. Since JavaScript is also an object oriented programming language, it supports inheritance. 
In Object oriented programming languages like C# and Java to implement inheritance, a class inherits from another class. 
In JavaScript, we don't have the concept of classes, so inheritance in JavaScript is prototype-based. 
This means to implement inheritance in JavaScript, an object inherits from another object. Let us understand this with an example.

/*   ------------------------ POLYMORPHISM    ------------------------ */
`
1.what is it?

Poly= many, morphism=form or behavior shifting.

2.why we need it ?

In programming, It is used when we want a function's (let say function X's) interface to be flexible enough to accept different types or number of parameters. 
Also, based on changing parameters types or numbers, we might want the function X to behave differently (morphism).

3.How it works?

We write multiple implementations of X function where each implementation accepts different parameters types or number of parameters.
 Based on the type or number of parameter, the compiler (at runtime) decides which implementation of X should be executed when X is called from some code.

4.how can I achieve this polymorphic behavior in javascript?

JS is not a typed language so it really not meant to use OOP concepts like polymorphism.
 However, the newer version of JS now include classes and there is possibility that polymosphism could start making sense in JS, too. 
 Other answers provide some interesting workarounds.
